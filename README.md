# Eigenstudy-Rings
Eigenstudy analyses of aggregated and satellite ring networks. 
Associated with the paper: (Bouis et al, 2025) "Insights on structure and influence from the adjacency and Laplacian eigenspectra of intersecting ring networks"

BACKGROUND: 
Eigenspectra analyses of ring-based networks, focusing on the difference between the adjacency and Laplacian spectra.  

CONTENTS: 
This repository contains the following analyses scenarios (along with key enabling functions): 
- aggregated_rings_analysis: study of rings embedded with hubs of high connectivity. The impact of changing the hub size is studied. 
- satellite_analysis: study of Walker-Delta constellations for 2- and 3-rings.
- satellite_analysis_avg_window: study of the impact of averaging windows on the network spectra.

PROJECT STATUS:
Project completed. 

AUTHORS and ACKNOWLEDGEMENT:
Agathe BOUIS with acknowledgements to the ApSTL group at the University of Strathclyde.
